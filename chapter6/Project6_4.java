/* Directions:
 * Write a program that solves the knapsack problem for an arbitrary knapsack 
 * capacity and series of weights. Assume the weights are stored in an array. 
 * Hint: The arguments to the recursive knapsack() function are the target 
 * weight and the array index where the remaining items start.
