/* Directions:
 * Suppose you buy a budget-priced pocket PC and discover that the chip inside 
 * canâ€™t do multiplication, only addition. You program your way out of this 
 * quandary by writing a recursive method, mult(), that performs multiplication 
 * of x and y by adding x to itself y times. Its arguments are x and y and its 
 * return value is the product of x and y. Write such a method and a main() 
 * program to call it. Does the addition take place when the method calls 
 * itself or when it returns?
 * 
 * ANSWER: When returning
